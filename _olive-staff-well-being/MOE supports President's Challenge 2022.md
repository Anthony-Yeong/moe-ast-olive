In support of the President's Challenge 2022, the MOE Community Involvement Programme (MCIP) Committee is coordinating MOE's efforts in supporting this cause through fundraising activities such as the PC Heart Train/Bus Campaign, OLive Steps Challenge for Charity 2022 and OLive Fiesta.  
  
"The COVID-19 pandemic has hastened Singapore's digitalisation efforts, but also has the potential to widen the digital divide. The President's Challenge hopes to support efforts to build a digitally inclusive society, where all Singaporeans feel excited, empowered and enriched by digital technologies." - President Halimah Yacob
