**Health Screening and Flu Vaccination at Minmed Clinics**

If you are unable to attend the on-site health screening and/or flu vaccination exercise organised by your school or HQ, you could make an appointment at one of Minmed's clinics to get this done. You may refer to the attached file for the guide on how to make an appointment.

[(2022) Making an Appointment with Minmed - FV and HS(.pdf, 186.79 KB)](/files/(2022)-making-an-appointment-with-minmed---fv-and-hs.pdf)

Please remember to bring along your Civil Service/Public Service Card on the day of appointment or verification.

**Frequently Asked Questions on the Flu Vaccine (FV)**
======================================================

**1\. Is it compulsory for MOE staff to be vaccinated against the flu virus?**

No. The objective of the flu vaccination exercise is to encourage MOE staff to take good care of their health.

**2\. What is the name/ type of the vaccine?**

Fluarix Tetra, Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (split virion, inactivated)

**3\. Is this the most updated vaccine?**

The current available vaccine is Northern Hemisphere (NH). Every season, MOH will announce in advance the recommendations of strains to be protected against in the season. You can read more on each type of the vaccine at the following websites:

Southern Hemisphere (SH)  

[https://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/2020\_south/en/](https://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/2020_south/en/)

Northern Hemisphere (NH)

[https://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/2020-21\_north/en/](https://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/2020-21_north/en/)

With reference to the above links, there will be changes in 2 strains in the upcoming NH’20/21: H1N1 & H3N2.

**4\. Which are the groups of people who may not be suitable / recommended for the FV?**

Infants younger than 6 months should not be given the flu vaccine. Hence it is important to vaccinate the caregivers instead.

Persons who are acutely unwell e.g. high fever, may be asked to defer the vaccination. Persons with mild symptoms like runny nose and cough can continue with the vaccination.

Pregnant ladies should get the flu vaccine. Fluarix Tetra is an inactivated influenza vaccine.

Egg allergy is not a contraindication to the flu vaccine. If there is no contraindication, then it is a recommended vaccine for everyone.

**5\. If I have already taken the FV in the last 6-9 months, can I take it again?**

There are two variants released a year. If you have taken one 6-9 months ago, it is probably the other variant, i.e. you took the southern hemisphere variant and now you are taking the northern hemisphere variant, or vice versa. If there is a change in the strains from the southern and northern strains, MOH will usually issue an advisory to take both.

**6\. What are some risks or side effects associated with taking the flu vaccine, if any?**

Common side effects will be the common cold symptoms and/or fever. There may also be a risk of allergy to the vaccine. Please see a doctor immediately if any of the following symptoms are present; rashes, shortness of breath, facial swelling, throat tightness

**7\. I have been administered with the COVID-19 vaccine. Can I receive another (non-COVID-19) vaccine at the same time? How long do I have to wait before getting other vaccines?**

There is no data on administering COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as other non-COVID-19 vaccines. A minimum interval of 14 days is recommended before or after any other vaccines i.e. other vaccines should not be administered 14 days or less before the first dose; or 14 days or less after the second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. _(Response adapted from MOH's FAQs on the COVID-19 Vaccination Programme)_

Making an Appointment
=====================

**1\. I am unable to participate in the on-site flu vaccination at my school. How do I make an appointment to get my flu vaccination at a Minmed clinic?**

For flu vaccination only, please go to [https://go.gov.sg/fvoffsite](https://go.gov.sg/fvoffsite) to make an appointment at one of Minmed clinics.

**2\. I used the link given to make an appointment to get my flu vaccination and was asked for a company code. What is my company code?**

*   For MOE HQ staff, please key in **MOE-HQ-2022**
*   For School staff, please key in **MOE-SCH-2022**

**3\. What happens if I miss my appointment?**

If you missed your appointment, please make a new one **within 1 month from the initial appointment date**. Officers can only register for the flu vaccine once a year thus there shall not be any extension of the deadline nor a replacement, if the vaccine is not consumed within the 1-month timeframe.

**Eligibility and Payment for the Flu Vaccine** 
================================================

**1. Who will be entitled for the fully subsidised flu vaccine?**

All MOE staff under the direct payroll of MOE are included. This includes the following officers:

*   Education officers, including Contract Teachers and Contract Adjunct Teachers
*   Allied Educators
*   Executive and Administrative staff
*   MOE Kindergarten Teachers
*   NIE Trainees

Staff needs to produce their Civil Service/Public Service card with the MOE sticker for verification on the day of the appointment.

**2\. Do I need to pay for the flu vaccine?**

The flu vaccine is fully subsidized by MOE. You need not pay upfront for the vaccine. The vendor will bill MOE directly for the consumed vaccine.

**3\. I have already used the $20/$40 health screening subsidy earlier in the year. Am I still eligible for the fully subsidized flu vaccine?**

The flu vaccine is on top of the health screening subsidy. It is separate from the $20/$40 health screening subsidy that you can use to offset additional health screening tests.

**4\. I recently went for the flu vaccination before the announcement of the fully subsidized flu vaccine for MOE staff. Can I make a claim for the vaccine that I took earlier?** 

The MOE fully subsidized flu vaccine benefit is effective from 21 Oct 2020. To enjoy this benefit, officers must consume the flu vaccine through MOE's appointed vendor i.e. Minmed Group Pte Ltd. Reimbursement for flu vaccines consumed at other clinics before and after 21 Oct 2020 is not allowed.
